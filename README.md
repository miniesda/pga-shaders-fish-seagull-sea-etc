Shaders project in Unity:

Movement shaders for seagulls and fish based on a tesselation and compute shader, applying behaviours based on position and distance to the pears (as voids)
Color shader based on height for the island materials
Grass shader based on height, angle, and the grass parameters of tesselation per camera distance, height and wind force
Movement shader for the sea, based on tesselation per distance, height maps and color change
Add a wireframe replicant for the sea
